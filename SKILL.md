  Skill Creator 2: the packaging and quality standard for Agent Skills, layered
  on Anthropic's skill-creator. Use whenever a skill is created, edited,
  recalibrated, validated, packaged, uploaded to claude.ai, or deployed to a
  local skills folder such as ~/.agents/skills - including "package this
  skill", "make a .skill file", "check my skill", "why isn't my skill
  triggering", "upgrade my skills", or before handing any skill to someone.
  Validates against the upload rules plus stricter checks (name equals folder,
  triggers in the description, every referenced file exists, no stale sandbox
  paths), then always produces both a .skill and a versioned .zip.

# Skill Creator 2 — Packaging & Quality Standards

This skill supplements Anthropic's `skill-creator` wherever it is installed (claude.ai, the Claude desktop app, a Claude Code plugin, or the `anthropics/skills` repository). Use skill-creator for the workflow — capture intent, draft, test prompts, evals, description optimization — and apply these standards on top. Without skill-creator, the standards below still stand on their own.

## 1. Validate before anything ships

```bash
python scripts/validate_skill.py <skill-folder> [--strict]
```

| Level | Means | Checks |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Error** | Upload would be rejected, or the skill is broken | Frontmatter keys other than name, description, license, allowed-tools, metadata, compatibility · name not kebab-case, over 64 characters, or different from its folder · description missing, over 1024 characters, or containing angle brackets · body over 500 lines · a referenced `references/`, `scripts/` or `assets/` path that does not exist · a bundled Python script that does not compile · more than one SKILL.md |
| **Warning** | The skill will trigger badly or age badly | No "when to use" cue in the description · trigger phrases kept in the body · files nothing points to · references over 300 lines without a contents list · junk files · sandbox paths from one surface, paths from a former user account, tool names only one surface has |

**Why the description carries the most weight:** it is the only text a model sees when deciding whether to load a skill. Trigger phrases written in the body are invisible at that moment. Put every "when to use" in the description, and make it a little pushy, as skill-creator advises — models tend to under-trigger skills.

## 2. Package: always both formats

```bash
python scripts/package_dual.py <skill-folder> --version <X.Y> [--output <dir>] [--deploy <skills-home>]
```

| File | For | Name |
|------|-----|------|
| `.skill` | claude.ai and the Claude desktop app: upload in skill settings, or open the file card an agent presents | `{name}.skill` — no version, always current |
| `.zip` | Keeping, and local agents: extract so the folder lands at `~/.agents/skills/{name}/` | `{name}-v{X.Y}.zip` |

Both are zip archives with `{name}/SKILL.md` at the root. The packager validates first and stops on any error. It leaves out `evals/` and `tests/` at the skill root, `*-workspace` folders, `__pycache__`, `node_modules`, `.git`, `.pyc` and OS junk.

`--deploy <skills-home>` also replaces the contents of `<skills-home>/{name}/` with exactly what was packaged. The folder itself stays, so junctions or symlinks agents use to reach it keep working. It refuses to write through a link, or over a folder whose SKILL.md names a different skill.

**Present both files** when a file-delivery tool exists (`present_files`, `SendUserFile`). Without one, say where both files are.

## 3. Documentation completeness

Every skill has:

1. **SKILL.md** — what it does and when (in the description), workflow, anti-patterns
2. **references/** — supporting docs SKILL.md points to, each saying when to read it
   - Justifies its existence (does not repeat SKILL.md)
   - Scannable: tables over prose, imperative form
   - Version and date in its header
3. **scripts/** (if any) — executable, with a docstring saying what it does, what it returns, and what it will never do

**User-friendly standard:** someone reading only SKILL.md understands what the skill does, when it triggers, and how to use it. References add depth, never prerequisites.

## 4. Version tracking

- `metadata.version` and `metadata.updated` in the frontmatter, and the version in the `.zip` name
- Former names and versions in a closing footnote when renamed or recalibrated

## 5. Updating an existing skill

- **Keep the name and folder** — agents and accounts know the skill by them.
- **Snapshot before editing.** The snapshot is the baseline every change is measured against.
- **Scripts get tests, and the test fails first.** Keep tests outside the skill folder so packaged and deployed copies stay identical to the development copy.
- **Name every older copy.** A skill often lives in several places at once: the development folder, a local skills home, one or more claude.ai accounts, a public repository, project folders. After packaging, list each place still holding the old version and who can refresh it. claude.ai copies change only when someone uploads the new `.skill`.

## Integration with skill-creator

Replace skill-creator's single `.skill` in **Package and Present** with dual packaging, and run the validator wherever skill-creator validates. Every other step — interview, research, writing guide, test cases, evals, description optimization, blind comparison — is unchanged.
